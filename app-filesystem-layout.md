# Application filesystem layout

## Location of applications on server
Locker server stores application data in `APPS_PATH` config variable which is `/opt/locker-apps` by default.

first level subdirectories are userid, second level subdirectories are application names. So, for application with URL like `notebook-user1.locker.example.com` it's files are in `/opt/locker-apps/user1/notebook/`.
